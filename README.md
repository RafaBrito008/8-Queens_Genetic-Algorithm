## Overview
This Python script is designed to solve the classic 8 Queens puzzle using a genetic algorithm. The puzzle involves placing eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. The script includes a graphical representation of the board and the solution.

## Features
- **Genetic Algorithm Implementation**: Uses genetic algorithms to find a solution, involving selection, crossover, and mutation functions.
- **Graphical Chessboard**: Utilizes the Tkinter library for visualizing the solution on a chessboard.
- **Performance Metrics**: Prints the generation number and the lowest number of attacks at each stage, enhancing understanding of the algorithm's progress.

## Requirements
- **Python**: The script is written in Python and requires Python 3.x to run.
- **Numpy**: For handling array operations and random selections.
- **Tkinter**: For rendering the graphical interface of the chessboard.

## Usage
1. **Installation**: Ensure Python 3.x, Numpy, and Tkinter are installed on your system.
2. **Running the Script**: Run the script in a Python environment. The script will automatically start the genetic algorithm process.
3. **Viewing the Solution**: Once a solution is found, the script will display the chessboard with queens placed in the solution positions.
